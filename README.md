# global playlist

i know that spotify has top 50 global playlist but tbh that playlist is just ass.
so i made this website where anyone can add any song to a playlist and people can
listen to what others are adding. you can add the songs you like for others to discover,
or just to rickroll others

the site is available at [https://global-playlist.vercel.app](https://global-playlist.vercel.app/)
(you can show generosity by suggesting/buying a better domain name for this)


## tech stack

im using react (with typescript) for the frontend of the site, and for the backend code
that adds the songs is a cloud function on firebase written in python


## contribution

you can contribute by 
- suggesting a new feature
- opening an issue
- making a pull request
- sharing the site with others

you can also buy me a coffee
